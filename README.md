# CodeGolf-Hackathon

Welcome to CodeGolf Hackathon! This is a competition whose goal is to find the shortest code in each (golfing) language in order to solve a specific programming puzzle. New problems will be posted periodically. There will be a couple of teams:

 - The [Jelly team](https://github.com/DennisMitchell/jelly).
 
 - The [Pyth team](https://github.com/isaacg1/pyth).
 
 - The [05AB1E team](https://github.com/Adriandmen/05AB1E).
 
 - The [Husk team](https://github.com/barbuz/Husk).
 
 - Other potential teams (?): [Japt](https://github.com/ETHproductions/japt/), [MATL](https://github.com/lmendo/MATL). On request, I can add more.
