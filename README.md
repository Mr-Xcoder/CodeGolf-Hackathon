# CodeGolf-Hackathon

Welcome to CodeGolf Hackathon! This is a competition whose goal is to find the shortest code in each (golfing) language in order to solve a specific programming puzzle. New problems will be posted periodically. There will be a couple of teams:

 - The [Jelly team](https://github.com/DennisMitchell/jelly).
 
 - The [Pyth team](https://github.com/isaacg1/pyth).
 
 - The [05AB1E team](https://github.com/Adriandmen/05AB1E).
 
 - The [Husk team](https://github.com/barbuz/Husk).
 
 - Other potential teams (?): [Japt](https://github.com/ETHproductions/japt/), [MATL](https://github.com/lmendo/MATL). On request, I can add more.

A golfer can participate in one or more teams. Good luck golfing!

## Rules

If you want to submit your answer to one of the Puzzles:

- Go to the Folder `Puzzle X`, where `X` is the number of the puzzle you want to solve.

- Go to `solutions` and choose one of the available langauge teams.

- There, create a new file called `<language-name>-<your-username>-<number-of-bytes>-bytes.<language-extension>`.

- Paste your submission in the newly created file, after *you make sure that it is correct*! Click *Commit Changes* and wait for me to merge it. 

- It is also recommended to create a markdown file that includes your code, a [TIO link](https://tio.run) and an explanation on how your code works, if needed.
